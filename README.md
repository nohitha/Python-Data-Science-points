# Python-Data-Science-points
* Comments in python can be done by using hash symbol.
* Syntactic error is when python does not unnderstand the code. eg: frint instead of print.
* Semantic error is when your logic is wrong.
* We can see the actual data type in python by using type command. eg: type(10)
* You can change the type of expression in python which is called type-casting. You can convert int to float or vice versa.
* 1. eg convert int to float. int 2 when converted to float gives 2.0, nothing really change.
* 2. While casting float to int you must be careful. eg: float 1.1 coverts to int gives 1, so you may loose some information.
* If a string contain an int you can convert to int.eg: int("2") gives 2 as integer.
* If we convert non-integer string as integer we get an error. eg: int("n") gives an error.
* You can convert an int to string or a float to a string.
* Boolean is a type in python which takes two values. The first value is true, we use only uppercase T and other is false, we use uppercase F.
* If you cast T to int or float it gives 1, F to int or float gives 0.
* Similarly, if you cast 1 to boolean gives T, 0 to boolean gives F.
# Variables and expressions
* We call numbers as operands and maths symbols as operators.
* In python division examples. eg 25/5 = 5 , 25/6 = 4.167.
* In python3, we can use double slash division(eg:20//2) for integers, where the result is rounded.In some cases the result is not same as regular division.
* Expressions in the bracket are performed first.
* we use colon to denote a value.
* we use asignment operator to asign variable.
